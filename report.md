# Websites to study

In this analysis, we will study two big websites used for streaming music:
- (Youtube Music)[https://music.youtube.com],
- (Spotify's web player)[https://open.spotify.com].

# Strive for consistency

Both sites are well designed in this regard.
Youtube Music follows Material Design, the same design guideline that is used
by all of Google's products.
And Spotify also has its own consistent style across its entire web player.

# Seek universality

When it comes to universality, Spotify takes the lead.
On Spotify's web app you can tab through all the elements
in the same order as they are rendered.
Meanwhile YouTube Music can't be reliably tabbed trough,
sometimes even skipping some elements
that you would expect to be focused on next.

# Offer informative feedback

Both sites are half decent in this regard.
They both show extra information when the user hovers over an element.
And they both also use snackbar messages about
the actions that the user has taken,
however, they aren't shown on all actions.
For example, Spotify only shows a snackbar
upon the adition of a song to a playlist, but not its removal.
Meanwhile YouTube does the opposite,
showing a snackbar when a song is removed from a playlist,
but not when it is added.

# Design dialogs to yield closure

The only dialog that both sites have is used for payment,
and both sites do a good job at it.
They both start with a clear message of what the user is about to pay for,
and then they both give the user options on how to pay for it.
Showing more elements as the user progresses trough the dialog.
Finally, both sites also show a summary of the payment before the user confirms it.
Finishing with a clear message of what the user has just paid for.

# Prevent errors

Both sites are fairly good in this regard, as they both use confirmation
modals for destructive actions,
and in the case of Youtube Music, when it doesn't show a modal, shows a snackbar with an undo button.

# Permit easy reversal of actions

When it comes to action reversal, Youtube Music is much better than Spotify,
as it allows the user to revert the removal of a song from a playlist.
While Spotify doesn't have that at all.
But even then, neither let you undo the deletion of playlists, so both sides also
have some room for improvement.

# Keep users in control

While both sites don't have a propper settings page,
they do have a player widget at the bottom of the screen
that can be used to control the playback.

# Reduce short-term memory load

Both sites are fairly good in this regard.
Upon opening either site, the last song you were listening to is displayed in the playback controller at the bottom.
This is a good way to remind the user of what they were listening to, and also allows them to quickly resume playback.
And in adition, the landing sites of both of these web apps show you the most recently played songs, artists and albums.

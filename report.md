# Websites to study

In this analysis, we will study two big websites used for streaming music:
- (Youtube Music)[https://music.youtube.com],
- (Spotify's web player)[https://open.spotify.com].

# Strive for consistency

Both sites are well designed in this regard.
Youtube Music follows Material Design, the same design guideline that is used
by all of Google's products.
And Spotify also has its own consistent style across its entire web player.

# Seek universality

When it comes to universality, Spotify takes the lead.
On Spotify's web app you can tab through all the elements
in the same order as they are rendered.
Meanwhile YouTube Music can't be reliably tabbed trough,
sometimes even skipping some selectable elements
that you would expect to be focused on next.

# Offer informative feedback

Both sites are half decent in this regard.
They mostly achieve this trough the use of toast messages,
but they aren't done on all actions.
For example, Spotify shows a toast message upon the adition of a song to a playlist,
but not on the removal of a song from a playlist.
Meanwhile Youtube Music does the opposite,
only showing a toast message upon the removal of a song from a playlist,
but not on adition.

# Design dialogs to yield closure

The only dialog that both sites have is used for payment.
And both sites do a good job at this.
They both start with a clear message of what the user is about to pay for,
and then they both give the user options on how to pay for it.
Showing more elements as the user progresses trough the dialog.
Finishing with a clear message of what the user has just paid for.

# Prevent errors

Both sites are fairly good in this regard, as they both use confirmation
modals for destructive actions,
and in the case of Youtube Music, when it doesn't show a modal, it lets the user to undo the action.

# Permit easy reversal of actions

When it comes to action reversal, Youtube Music is much better than Spotify,
as it allows the user to revert the removal of a song from a playlist.
While Spotify doesn't have that at all.
But even then, neither let you undo the deletion of playlists, so both sides also
have some room for improvement.

# Keep users in control

While both sites don't have a settings page,
both sites have a player control bar at the bottom of the screen,
which fully controls the music being playbacked.

# Reduce short-term memory load

Both sites are fairly good in this regard.
Upon opening either site, the last song played is displayed in the playback controller at the bottom,
letting the user to continue listening where they stopped in the last session.
And in adition, the landing sites of both of these web apps

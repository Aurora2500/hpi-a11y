# Websites to study

In this analysis, we will study two big websites used for streaming music:
- (Youtube Music)[https://music.youtube.com],
- (Spotify's web player)[https://open.spotify.com].

# Strive for consistency

Both sites are well designed in this regard.
Youtube Music follows Material Design, the same design guideline that is used
by all of Google's products.
And Spotify also has its own consistent style across its entire web player.

# Seek universality



# Offer informative feedback

# Design dialogs to yield closure

# Prevent errors

# Permit easy reversal of actions

When it comes to action reversal, Youtube Music is much better than Spotify.


# Keep users in control

While both sites don't have a settings page,
both sites have a player control bar at the bottom of the screen,
which fully controls the music being playbacked.

# Reduce short-term memory load
